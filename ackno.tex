\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

Let me first thank professors Jean-Fran√ßois Remacle and Michael Hanke to have allowed me to work on the subject presented here. The guidance they provided throughout the definition of the algorithms, the implementation and the redaction was really appreciated. Their knowledge of the field also really helped me navigate the immense literature that is available about the subject at hand. 


They say the devil is in the details and this thesis has had a lot of devils in it. Many thanks to Antoine David, Joachim L'Hoir and Robin Parez for their thoughtful recommendations about several aspects of the work that follows. The useful discussions we had about my work helped me to shed some light on a lot of devils.   

I would also like to thank my close friends and family, who were always available for some engineering talk on both rainy and sunny days. 

Finally, I would like to thanks Charlotte Jallet for her incommensurable and unwavering support until the completion of this thesis.
